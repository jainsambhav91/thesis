Abstract:
This thesis is about the visual exploration of the sex offender registry laws and an attempt to understand how examining these laws from an objective lens can debunk myths about society. Moreover, it also tries to explore the collateral consequences that these laws have, specifically the residence restrictions that it imposes on offenders, and raises questions about the effectiveness of their intentions.
I have chosen the sex offender registry laws as my topic of research because at times when we are dealing with issues that are sensitive, such as this one, we fail to look at the complete picture before we form opinions and take actions. I believe this analysis will produce some unexpected answers to questions like: Who is required to register in the sex offender registry? For how long? Do they have a high risk of reoffending? Are all victims under eighteen? What proportion of sex offenders are juveniles, what proportion are women? How are residence restrictions imposed on offenders? What proportion of a city is inaccessible to them as a result of these restrictions? Are these restrictions effective in regards to what the intend to achieve?
I will approach this project from three different stages. Starting at a macro level, visualizing these laws from the national viewpoint, trying to answer broader questions about their history, their inception, and presence across the country. I will then move to the state level, where narrower questions about the sex offender registry and their demographic make-up will be addressed. Finally, I will move to the district level, which will examine the impact of the collateral consequences in detail.
- summarize the project and the approach, talk about data

Generalizng the project:
- Laws different in different states
- Organize list of schools, parks, day cares for all states and cities
- Encode the statutes (regulations within the state sex offender registry laws) as data points that can be passed as parameters for the visualization

I am hoping that this work will compel the user to look at a sensitive topic, such as this one, from a different perspective, at the same time making them well informed and aware, rectifying myths and misconceptions along the way. (elaborate)
This will also serve as a tool for the lawmakers to visualize what the consequences of their actions might look like, and help them to preempt decisions that may not be in the best interest of the society. (elaborate)

Things to add:
- Earlier works in the field: 
1. Ravel: a tool that combines legal research and analytics. For lawyers to research cases and craft arguments
2. Other examples that help lawyers cater to their customers by visualizing legal contracts





1.	Introduction:
-	Elaborate Stories
-	Individual stories

1.1.	History and Inception of Current Sex Offender Laws:
In 1989, Jacob Wetterling, a young boy in the city of St. Joseph, Minnesota while riding his bike home, was abducted, sexually assaulted and murdered (Jacob Wetterling Resource Center, 2008). A federal legislation, The Jacob Wetterling Crimes against Children and Sexually Violent Offender Registration Act, was passed in 1994 in honor of Jacob. The act, for the first time, required all states to maintain a registry of offenders who were convicted of sexual and certain other offenses against children. Since then, based on certain high-profile cases of child sexual abuse, a number of laws and extensions have been passed with the intent of protecting children against offenders. Nature of these laws barbarous; were passed due to extensive media hype and political pressure 
Talk about other laws that were passed during the timeline.

1.2.	Current Laws and Collateral Consequences:
Talk about: collateral consequences – residence restrictions, resulting consequences


1.3.	Myths and Facts:
Approximately 60% of males and 80% of female child victims are abused by a person who is known to the victim (Lieb, Quinsey, and Berliner, 1998). If that is the case, it is more likely that offenders have access to children in a private premises and may not necessarily pursue their victims in public places such as parks, schools or day care centers.

The risk posed by all sex offenders is not the same

Myth: Sexual offense rates are higher than ever and continue to climb

All ‘categories’ of sex offenders not the same

1.4.	Why current laws do not make sense:
Talk about: 
-	laws should be rehabilitative, but alienate sex offenders from society even after they have served their term
-	Are vague: safety zones are not clearly defined
-	Different categories of sex offenders; should be treated differently

1.5.	How do we solve this problem?
Approach
1.5.1.	How can we use objective evidence to design laws? (for lawmakers)
How are laws passed?
What evidences are taken into account?
How important is the use of data in defining what the law entails?

1.5.2.	How can we debunk myths? (for people)
